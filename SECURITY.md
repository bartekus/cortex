## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Cortex serious.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do **not** open a public issue.
Instead, please report it via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/bartekus/cortex/security/advisories/new) or contact the maintainer directly.
